## To Run

For convenience (similar to angular-seed) using http-server for a local webserver. The server can be started with:
  
`npm start`

And the app can then be accessed from:

`http://localhost:8000/`

## Comments

* Normally you wouldn't commit the node_modules directory (and instead add it to .gitignore), but adding it for 
convenience.
